## OSF-1 score  
Open-source-friendliness v1, OSF-1 is a metric used to score the open-source friendlyness of a product.  

Categorical score:
0: Fully open-source with permissive license  
0.1: Open source-code with somewhat limited / copyleft license
0.2: Open source-code with limited / noncommercial license / obscure licenses, e.g. openrail
0.3: Proprietary optional / swappable software for customizable hardware
0.5: Partially closed-open-source - weighted based on code importance
0.7: Closed source, developer friendly with SDK / consumer API
1.0: Fully proprietary with DRM  

Should calculate weighted average of feature volume.
